# News Collection (New York Times News Scraper)

## Overview

News Collection is an application that scrapes articles from the New York Times website and stores information into a NoSQL database (mongodb) then displays the results on the page. The user is able to save and delete articles to and from their account, add comments to individual articles, and delete their comments. The front-end is mobile responsive and was created using mdbootstrap along with handlebars for HTML templating. Here is how the site works.
